# PlayerTrack

Dalamud plugin to keep track of players you meet in FFXIV. 

PlayerTrack helps you keep a record of who you meet and the content you played together. By default, this is instanced content only - but you can expand or restrict this in settings. You can see all the details on a player by clicking on their name in the overlay. Here you can also record notes and set a personalized icon/color. PlayerTrack uses Lodestone to keep the data updated (e.g. world transfers). If this happens, you'll see an indicator next to their home world and can mouse-over to see their previous residence.

## Features
- Record who you've played with and what the content was.
- Keep notes on players to remember when you see them again months later.
- Set chat alerts that will trigger when you see someone.
- Create and group players by categories with custom colors and icons.
- Add, Search, and Delete players from your list.
- Sync with Lodestone to keep players updated across name and world changes.
- Open a player's Lodestone profile with a click.
- Configure when the plugin runs (always, instances, savage, etc.).
- Set target by right-clicking on a player's name.
- Set focus target by hovering on a player's name (off by default).
- View character stats like tribe and height (off by default).
